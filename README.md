# SIS
a very simple toy CPU arch, with an assembler

## note:
this project has been on hold and is only on here for archiving

## the way it works
- first assemble the code then feed it to SIS
- r: to dump registers
- c: to step the clock
- m: to dump memory

the instruction set is loosely RISC based, it's very incomplete and can only handle arithmetic operations.
